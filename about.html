                <h3>Who am I and what are you doing here?</h3>
                <h3>I’m Vene, and if you’re reading this, well, you’re probably someone at Pratt Institute. </h3>

                <h3>Sadly, Young Charm is merely a figment of my imagination. But the scene it references was real and very near and dear to my heart.</h3>

                <h3>I came to know punk rock as a senior in high school in Nogales, Arizona in 1996. My introduction came via The Ramones, The Clash, The Dead Kennedys, and The Muffs. For me, punk was as much about the ethos as it was about the music.</h3>

                <h3>I read every single word of every single <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.maximumrocknroll.com"><i>Maximum RocknRoll</i></a> edition I could get my hands on, sending away cash in an envelope many times over for CD singles and albums from bands all over the world.</h3>

                <h3>It gave me a way out of my hometown, and something bigger to believe in than myself.</h3>

                <h3>I hope you’ve enjoyed this website and the lives of three musicians who never existed in fact, but are heavily influenced by other bands and musicians who have made a deep impression on me to this day.</h3>

                <h3>
                    All the artwork used on this website is my own. If you'd like to see more, check out the drawings and on my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/vene_la_green_eyez/">Instagram</a> account and in my Highlights under "Doodles" and "Animated". </h3>

                <h3> I also hope you find a film on the <a href="film.html">Film Recommendation</a> page that you’ve yet to see. The list, of course, is not exhaustive. If there’s something I’ve missed that you’d like to recommend, please email me at my Pratt address (iykyk) and let me know!</h3>

                <h3>Thanks.</h3>
